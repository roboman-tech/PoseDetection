About

AI Pose-Controlled Human Generation is a project leveraging computer vision and AI-based pose detection to track human movements in real-time and generate human-like actions.

Originally designed for game control (e.g., Subway Surfers), this system can also be extended for:

AI avatar generation

Motion capture

Interactive virtual humans

Features

Real-time human pose detection

Generation of human-like actions based on movement

Integration with games or interactive applications

Expandable to virtual avatars and animation pipelines

Tech Stack

Computer Vision: OpenCV, MediaPipe, or similar frameworks

AI/ML: PyTorch / TensorFlow

Languages: Python

Optional: Unity or Unreal Engine integration for real-time applications
